# Vector vs Linked List
## About the project
This project was made during the course of Algorithms and Data Structures at Warsaw University of Technology to compare efficiency of vector and linked list data structures in given use cases.

We've been given unit tests and had to implement proper data structures to pass them. Then we tested our classes against time efficiency.
